        <documentation>WaterML2.0 provides specializations of the O&amp;M model. These specialisation focus on a structure for encoding time series information relevant to in-situ hydrological observations.

All specializations _restrict_ the targets of various associations, so that generalized classes are overridden by more specific ones. 

The generic O&amp;M models are capable of describing all water monitoring applications, but it is useful to apply restrictions to some of the generic elements in order to define implementation classes.

Background
-------------------

The OGC discussion paper 09-124 - "Harmonisation standards for water observation data"provides some initial analysis of exisiting standards for water observation data. It was proposed that a common model (and thus schema) may be developed to enhance re-usability across organisations. This model represents a version of a harmonised model that contains concepts that have been identified across the exisiting standards. This model will be used to generate schema for testing against various use cases for data exchange and sharing.
