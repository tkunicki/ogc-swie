This property will most likely reference a term in code list (e.g. ‘Validated’, ‘Provisional’). "
We are unsure how to use this here since often there will be provisional and accepted data in the same timeseries -->

this will still depend on the procedure used for the observation. For automated sensors producing continuous measurements, this will most likely be the time of the end of last point in the time series.
For algorithms, sensors and manual methods, this will be time when the result time series becomes available, for example, when an algorithm or model has completed.
