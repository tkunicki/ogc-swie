            <documentation>The Hydrologic Unit system is a standardized watershed classification system developed by USGS in the mid 1970s. Hydrologic units are watershed boundaries organized in a nested hierarchy by size.
http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/tutorial/huc_def.html

The drainage basin concept is expanded upon in hierarchical systems of hydrologic units. In the United States, an effort is being made to delineate hydrologic units in a six level hierarchy covering the entire country and adhering to a standard called the "Federal Standard for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries". The six nested levels of hydrologic unit regions are named, from largest to smallest, regions, subregions, basins, subbasins, watersheds, and subwatersheds. The system defines 21 hydrologic unit (HU) regions in the United States, 222 HU subregions, 352 HU basins, and 2,149 HU subbasins. The delineation of 5th level watersheds and 6th level subwatersheds is not complete, but estimates predict about 22,000 watersheds and 160,000 subwatersheds in the United States.

            <documentation>A drainage basin is an extent of land where water from rain or snow melt drains downhill into a body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea or ocean. The drainage basin includes both the streams and rivers that convey the water as well as the land surfaces from which water drains into those channels, and is separated from adjacent basins by a drainage divide.[1]

The drainage basin acts like a funnel, collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it into a waterway. Each drainage basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a geographical barrier such as a ridge, hill or mountain, which is known as a water divide.

Other terms that are used to describe a drainage basin are catchment, catchment area, catchment basin, drainage area, river basin, water basin and watershed.[2] In the technical sense, a watershed refers to a divide that separates one drainage area from another drainage area.[3] However, in the United States and Canada, the term is often used to mean a drainage basin or catchment area itself. Watersheds drain into other watersheds in a hierarchical form, larger ones breaking into smaller ones or sub-watersheds with the topography determining where the water flows.
